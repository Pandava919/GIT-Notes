            <p>Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control
                source
                code by programmers.</p>

            <h3>2. What is GitHub?</h3>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>GitHub is a developer storage platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their
                code and
                allows developers to work together. It uses Git software, which provides distributed version control of
                access
                control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration for every
                project.</p>

                project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not
                available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new
                project.</p>

            <p>The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see
                which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.</p>
